    The Internet revolution has not only digitized our lifestyles, but also introduced the challenge of _information invisibility_. Vital knowledge remains unseen due to ranking algorithms that maximize engagement, coupled with our limited mental capacity to process massive information ourselves. As a result, we are almost always consuming the tip of a pre-ranked information iceberg. _The (In)visible Hub_ poses urgent questions about the extent and resolution of our digital blind spots by aiming to:
             
    1.  dynamically calculate how much information stays invisible
    2.  actively make invisible information sources visible
