# üïØÔ∏è (in)visible

The Internet revolution has not only digitized our lifestyles, but also introduced the challenge of _information invisibility_. Vital knowledge remains unseen due to ranking algorithms that maximize engagement, coupled with our limited mental capacity to process massive information ourselves. As a result, we are almost always consuming the tip of a pre-ranked information iceberg. _(In)visible_ poses urgent questions about the extent and resolution of our digital blind spots by aiming to:

1. dynamically calculate how much information stays invisible
2. actively make invisible information sources visible
