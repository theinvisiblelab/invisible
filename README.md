The Internet has transformed our lives, but has also introduced the challenge of _invisible information_ ‚Äî vital knowledge we consistently miss out on. In today's world of exponentially growing information, algorithms prioritize content that maximizes consumption, and humans deal with this already priotized content by consistently consuming the tip of the information iceberg. This is the challenge that The (In)visible Lab aims to tackle ‚Äî by understanding, quantifying, and boosting invisible knowledge across the Internet.
